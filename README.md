For hackathon I have created this structure application in NEXT JS .  It is the incomplete version of Figma Template 6
Although I have used help of chatgpt as well as readymadeui too along with tailwind css website for its classes but as my first priority was to learn and then implement on it and due to longtime loadsheding I was unable to finish it. 
Time was also too short for Q2 students who had no any prior experience of these tools and I am one of them because it was my first time I was using figma so many parts and many tasks are still incomplete. 
Hope it will be complete soon after this hackaton.

Best regards,
